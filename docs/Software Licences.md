# Software Licenses

This document describes the legal software licenses that are involved with the usage of Mass Transit and RabbitMQ software.

RabbitMQ requires the Erlang/OTP runtime to be installed, so it is listed as a dependency.

According to https://tldrlegal.com we wonâ€™t have any problem with any license as long as we mention we use each software as a dependency.
Note that this website is not official legal advice.
